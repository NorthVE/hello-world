Octavia or Raven? BOTH! 
Octavia is a *Martial Artist*. Raven knows how to _code_ and she is a *fantastic* _software and hardware repair tech_!... Last week, for example, I learned how to solder components. This week, I've begun learning how to write in Markdown and use GitHub.[From The 100](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2661044/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
